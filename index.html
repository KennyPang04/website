                    I'm a sophomore student studying Computer Science at the University at Buffalo. 
                    So far, I am unsure what I want to specialize, but I am willing to explore many 
                    other areas in CS to widen my knowledge. I have worked with robotics, computer 
                    vision, and app/software development. A few of my goals are making the internet 
                    a safer place and trying to create peace throughout the world. Although my dreams 
                    may seem unrealistic, I believe that anything is possible! Outside of work, I enjoy 
                    activities such as spending quality time with my family and playing video games 
                    with friends!
